# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch ðŸ§ 

This repository contains implementations of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms written from scratch using Python and NumPy. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of how these algorithms work under the hood â€” without relying on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## âœ… Algorithms Implemented

### 1. Linear Regression
### 2. Perceptron
### 3. Adaline
### 4. Perceptron using Sikit Learn
### 5. Logistic Regression
### 6. Decision Tree
